# ChromeBluetooth
 Demo to show how to use Chrome to connect to a heart rate monitor, as well as a Bluetooth smart bulb.  The ultimate goal creates a "Stress Display" that uses the heart rate value, to display a "traffic light" stress meter.  This consists of various shades of green, yellow or red depending on the heart rate value.

## This will demonstrate how to use Chromes' bluetooth capabilities to:
- Read battery status
- Read heart rate information
- Hacking into a smart bulb (Sharper Image LED Bulb Bluetooth Speaker - SBT5007)

## Runs on Chrome browsers on:
- Mac
- PC
- Smartphones
  * Android
  * IPhone
  * Windows 

## Requirements:
- Chrome version 56+

## To try it out! (Live Demo):
